## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How is this different from email?**  
A: Epistula is designed specifically for thoughtful correspondence. It provides threading, AI integration, and an interface optimized for meaningful exchanges rather than quick messages.

**Q: Do I need to respond immediately?**  
A: No! The whole point is asynchronous communication. Respond when you can think clearly and write thoughtfully.

**Q: Can others see my letters?**  
A: Only the people you send to can see your letters. Your correspondence is private.

**Q: How long should a letter be?**  
A: As long as needed to express your thoughts fully. Quality over quantity.

### For Students

**Q: Will using AI to develop my ideas be considered cheating?**  
A: That depends on your assignment and professor's guidelines. Using AI as a thinking partner (like a study buddy) is different from having AI write for you. Always follow your professor's academic integrity policies.

**Q: Can professors see my AI conversations?**  
A: Only if you share them. Your AI correspondence is private unless you choose to share it.

**Q: What if I make mistakes in my letters?**  
A: That's okay! Letters are about developing ideas, not perfection. Focus on clear thinking and honest expression.

### For Professors

**Q: How do I monitor student use of AI assistance?**  
A: Focus on the development of student thinking visible in their letters. Authentic learning shows in how ideas develop over time.

**Q: Can I use this for graded assignments?**  
A: Yes! You can use correspondence as part of participation grades, reflective practice, or formative assessment.

**Q: How many students can I correspond with effectively?**  
A: Because letters are asynchronous, you can manage more conversations than synchronous office hours. Start small and scale based on your capacity.
