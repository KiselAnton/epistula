# epistula

A platform for exchanging letters with peers and AI - thoughtful, asynchronous communication.

## Overview

Epistula is a modern take on letter-writing, combining the thoughtfulness of asynchronous correspondence with the power of AI assistance. Whether writing to peers or engaging with AI, epistula provides a space for meaningful, deliberate communication.
